  <p align= "justify"> This article conducts a literature review into the current state of underwater swarm robotics; it covers the design of the underwater robots, the methods used by the individual robot to perceive their environment, how they can localize to said environment, the methods of communication available underwater, centralized and decentralized control, the basis of swarm algorithms, the behaviors that are exhibited when a swarm works collectively and how swarms have been applied underwater.

  <p align= "justify"> This article has shown that microrobotic swarms with well-defined collective order can be fabricated via dynamic self-assembly of magnetic particles into mobile microrobotic linear chains that communicate with each other through engineered magnetic interactions.

  <p align= "justify"> This article has discussed about a tool, presented in previous works, able to describe strain deformation of a continuum medium, taking in account complex physical effects, in a plausible way. The tool is based on position-based dynamic. The proposed algorithm is derived from flocking rules, governing the configuration
of an underwater robot swarm; we have found they can profitably used to this purpose. The strain is imposed on some particles (leaders) whose motion is assigned, and the other particles (followers) move according to some rules governing particle position. The motion of the followers is determined, like in a bird swarm, by the position of their neighbours. The rules are that we used to control robot swarm configuration. So far the deformed configuration is calculated not by Newton law but only by the relative positions between the particles of the system, by the characteristics of the lattice and by rules describing how a particle would like to place with respect to its neighbours.

  <p align= "justify"> This article has discussed about simulated size-variable modules in order to take advantage of this effect and induce intra-swarm module migration. Intra-swarm module migration refers to the movement of the modules within the confines of the swarm, relative to each other, as well as the swarm container. Authors introduced two
methods to produce different kinds of module movement. The first of these, called the flashlight method, induced movement of an individual module relative to its neighbours. The second, called the zone method, induced an orientation-aligned global module motion within the swarm. In this work, authors evaluate the effects of different parameters on the nature of the movements induced by these methods.

  <p align= "justify"> In this article, a new formation for swarm robotic systems is introduced. This formation, which is made up of a portion of swarm members and encircles the whole swarm, is called the shell formation. In this regard, an effective algorithm for developing the shell formation in swarm robotic systems is established. The interaction mechanism among swarm agents is based on the method of artificial potential fields and the local rule of the nearest neighbor. Subsequently, inspired by the thermodynamic science and based on the introduced shell formation, the thermodynamic concept of pressure is generalized to swarm robotic systems. Finally, the efficacy of the introduced shell formation in solving the problem of passing through a narrow passage is studied via numerical simulations.
